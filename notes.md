[Twitter bootstrap for easy, slick responsive design](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)

NEED TODO:
Add ability to optionally create a score target for a goal. The UI should allow for assigning the target label and target score
example
  label:wpm
  target_score:13

Each milestone, when the goal has a target score, should allow entering a score that is less than or equal to the goal target score
Changing the goal target score should validate the milestones target scores do not exceed the goal target 
an assessment should be recordable from the goal overview screen
